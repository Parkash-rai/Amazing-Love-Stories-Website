  	<h1>Accident with a happy ending</h1>
    <p>When Frank’s wife had a car accident, she was so injured that she fell into a coma. Years passed but Frank did not stop visiting his wife at the hospital. Even though almost everyone – including the doctors – had given up hope, he remained faithful that she would one day recover. Every time he visited her, he began talking to her, recounting all those beautiful moments they spend with each other. One day, when he showed her the video of their wedding day, she slowly began to move her hand. She whispered his name and began gaining consciousness. Several weeks after she had woken up, she had fully recovered and was finally allowed to leave the hospital for good. When the couple left, she told Frank that she heard his voice while she was in a coma and that it was his voice that was the greatest aid in helping her to return to consciousness.</p>
    <h1>Love letters from the Caribbean</h1>
    <p>In 1907, David Hurd moved from his hometown in Jamaica to New York City. The migration wasn’t easy for the young man and he became terribly homesick. He missed his hometown and the company of his friends. In order to distract himself, David Hurd began searching for a potential pen-friend from his homeland. He found a woman called Avril Cato from the Caribbean who was interested in establishing a correspondence with him.

The two slowly got to know each other, with one letter after the other. One year later, the two had fallen in love with each other, without having ever met. Seven years later, Avril and David met for the first time. It was the day before their wedding, as David had proposed to her shortly before. The two married and had six children.</p>
